<p> The seed stitch is a simple variation on the core stitch of knitting, which is commonly referred to as a straigh stitich or a garter stitch. The only difference between the basic stitch and the seed stitch is the use of an alternating purl stitch as opposed to justing just a repating straight stitch. The alternation and subsequent grouping of yarn is then what creates the different texture, and gives any pattern a distinct look.</p>

<p> Ravelry.com is useful because it has many different indices and categories in which the user can search through based on their pattern needs. One downfall is that it is hard to retrace your steps and find a pattern again without saving it, as it will often reorder patterns, and feature different results from your prior searches.</p>
